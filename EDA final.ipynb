      "Found ['lcd', 'screen'] in it ' s great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen .\n",
      "Found ['4x', 'zoom'] in 3 ) 4x zoom is nice\n",
      "Found ['lcd', 'screen'] in 4 ) the great thing about digital , in general , is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture , not two weeks later when you get the film developed .\n",
      "Found ['mode', 'manual'] in you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on - screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus .\n",

      "Found ['battery', 'life'] in i tried out some other brands in the stores , and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company ; plus what you see in the lcd ( no optical finder ) is n ' t what you get - not even for color ; the output was less than i expected .\n",

      "Found ['i', 'use'] in i am a long - time user of highly responsive film slrs and professional quality external flash equipment , just so you know my bias .\n",
      "Found ['flash', 'external'] in relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .\n",
      "Found ['flash', 'external'] in fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct - 4 .\n",
      "Found ['flash', 'external'] in i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera , but i can use my metz , with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct - 4 .\n",

      "Found ['metz', 'flash'] in for those who have this metz flash ( or the 45cl - 3 ) and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3 , the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c .\n",
      "Found ['mode', 'manual'] in in order for this to work , you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f - stop yourself .\n",
      "Found ['shutter', 'speed'] in in order for this to work , you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f - stop yourself .\n",
      "Found ['metz', 'flash'] in then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel , because they are all ignored .\n",
      "Found ['metz', 'flash'] in the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash , and most of the time , the exposure is spot on and when it isnt , its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself .\n",
      "Found ['metz', 'flash'] in unfortunately , the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available , so the first problem cant easily be solved .\n",
      "Found ['film', 'camera'] in but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range , the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera .\n",
      "Found ['raw', 'image'] in now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !\n",
      "Found ['raw', 'image'] in the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image - affecting settings in the camera .\n",
      "Found ['raw', 'image'] in maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software , youd see the true , raw image that the camera actually produces .\n",
      "Found ['raw', 'image'] in without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image !\n",
      "Found ['raw', 'image'] in what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical .\n",
      "Found ['raw', 'image'] in i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .\n",
      "Found ['battery', 'life'] in battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k . reeves .\n",
      "Found ['digital', 'camera'] in battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k . reeves .\n",

      "Found ['digital', 'camera'] in if you do n ' t believe me on that , check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there .\n",
      "Found ['online', 'review'] in after reading the very positive review of this camera in a leading consumer magazine , i decided to head here , to amazon , to read through the online reviews .\n",
      "Found ['mode', 'manual'] in the camera is a dream to operate in automode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes .\n",
      "Found ['online', 'review'] in about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder .\n",
      "Found ['battery', 'life'] in 2 . battery life is over 4 . 5 hours , compared to about 2 . 5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons .\n",
      "Found ['digital', 'camera'] in when shopping for digital cameras i looked at the nikon cp5700 , olympus c5050 , nikon cp5000 , and the canon g3 .\n",
      "Found ['canon', 'g3'] in when shopping for digital cameras i looked at the nikon cp5700 , olympus c5050 , nikon cp5000 , and the canon g3 .\n",
      "Found ['optical', 'zoom'] in + they have great optics ( cp5700 has great optical zoom ) and features , not to mention take great pictures .\n",
      "Found ['lcd', 'screen'] in - the drawbacks were that they were not user friendly for the casual photographer , the lcd screen is a little too small , cp5000 does not take photos in raw format .\n",
      "Found ['lcd', 'screen'] in - i did n ' t care much for the tilting lcd screen , it seemed very limited and not very usefull .\n",

      "Found ['digital', 'camera'] in a lot of research went into digital camera ' s before i made this purchase , and hands down , the g3 had everything i needed plus more .\n",
      "Found ['powershot', 'g3'] in the powershot g3 is a great camera .\n",
      "Found ['digital', 'camera'] in the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .\n",

      "Found ['digital', 'camera'] in prior to the purchase , none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture .\n",
      "Found ['film', 'camera'] in this is not the same thing as a film camera .\n",
      "Found ['digital', 'camera'] in a 35mm film camera captures the moments you want , while these digital cameras ( my friends now inform me ) all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture .\n",
      "Found ['film', 'camera'] in a 35mm film camera captures the moments you want , while these digital cameras ( my friends now inform me ) all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture .\n",
      "Found ['film', 'camera'] in but do not assume , as i did , that the g3 has the same ability as [ your current film camera ] to stop the moment you choose .\n",
      "Found ['film', 'camera'] in from a dime store disposable to a top of the line eos , all film cameras share this ability to capture the moment you tell them to .\n",
      "Found ['digital', 'camera'] in this is my first digital camera and i could n ' t be happier .\n",
      "Found ['canon', 'g3'] in the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there .\n",
      "Found ['cap', 'lens'] in 1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera .\n",
      "Found ['cap', 'lens'] in though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display \" lens \" when the cap and the camera are both on , the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself .\n",
      "Found ['cap', 'lens'] in i ' m concerned that with the easily removed lens cap , i may damage the lens .\n",
      "Found ['mode', 'auto'] in it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features , so i generally used the auto mode .\n",
      "Found ['battery', 'life'] in another point of note : the battery life is incredible !\n",
      "Found ['digital', 'camera'] in i ' ve been looking to buy a digital camera for a long time and v = finally decided that now was the time .\n",
      "Found ['optical', 'zoom'] in the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom .\n",
      "Found ['digital', 'camera'] in as i said , this is the last digital camera i ' ll buy , and if you are in the market one , my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever .\n",
      "Found ['digital', 'camera'] in these things may get a lot better in the future , but from what i ' ve seen in the last few years , the technology for digital cameras is n ' t advancing at the pace of pc ' s , phones and hard drives .\n",

       "  'i just told them , press halfway , wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way . \\n',\n",

       "  \"i 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1/2 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine ) . \\n\",\n",
       "  \"ensure you get a larger flash , 128 or 256 , some are selling with the larger flash , 32mb will do in a pinch but you 'll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras . \\n\",\n",

       "  \"just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera , its 4 megapixel and ( alsmost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance . \\n\",\n",
